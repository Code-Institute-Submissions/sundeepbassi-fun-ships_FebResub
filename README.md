- Fun-Ships is battleship game designed on the original board game  

- For more information about battleships check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)])

- Funships is coded in python and the code is outputted in the terminal the game is also deployed to Heroku.

- The game is designed to be played by a single person.


## How To Play

- The player has to input a number from 1 to 8.

- Then the player has to input a letter between A and H.

- X on the board is for placing and getting a ship.

- The player has a chance to try and get 5 ships.

### Future Features

- Allow player to have the opportunity to play against someone else.

- Allow player to have more chances to attack the ships.

###  Data Model



###  Testing

- I did manual testing on the project by:

- Putting the code into the Pep8 validator testing check.  The code was passed without any significant problems and errors.

- I also did tests on the inputs to see what would happen if incorrect data was inputted.

- The code was also tested on the local terminal and in Heroku. 



###  Bugs


###  Remaining Bugs



###  Validator Testing
- pep8
       - No errors were returned from pep8online.com.


###  Deployment
- The project was deployed using the code Instiutes mock terminal for Heroku.

  - Steps for deployment:
      - Fork or clone this repository
      - Creat a new Heroku app
      - Set the build blocks to Python and Nodejs in that order 
      - Link the Heroku app to the repository
      - Click on **Deploy**
