# Fun-Ships

- Fun-Ships is battleship game designed on the original board game  

- For more information about battleships check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)])

- Funships is coded in python and the code is outputted in the terminal the game is also deployed to Heroku.

- The game is designed to be played by a single person.


## How To Play

- The player has to input a number from 1 to 8.

- Then the player has to input a letter between A and H.

- X on the board is for placing and getting a ship.

- "-" is a missed shot.



## Features


### Existing Features

- There ia a grid board for the player to play the game.

- The player is given an option to input a number value for the rows.

- The player is given an option to input a letter value for the columns.

- The player has a chance to try and get 5 ships.

### Future Features

- Allow player to have the opportunity to play against someone else.

- Allow player to have more chances to attack the ships.

###  Data Model
 
The model that I am using for this project is based on a grid board functions.
In the game there are.

The grid board class contains both the players and the computers boards.

Explain the xs and the - 

The grid board class contains the letters for the rows, the numbers for the columns, the amount of times to hit a ship.

The grid class board enables the  inputting of information for the ships and the output from the computer.

NEED TO UPDATE THIS ONCE THE COMPUTER GRID BOARD IS ALSO PLACED IN THE GAME.

###  Testing

- I did manual testing on the project by:

- Putting the code into the Pep8 validator testing check.  The code was passed without any significant problems and errors.

- I also did tests on the inputs to see what would happen if incorrect data was inputted.

- The code was also tested on the local terminal and in Heroku. 



###  Bugs

- There were bugs in the code that inhibited it from running properly.  I had to contact tutor support and reach out
to the slack community for support.

The bugs were removed and it was the tutorial from Knowledge Mavens that helped remove the bugs.

###  Remaining Bugs



###  Validator Testing

- Removed errors from code after checking in pep8 mainly indentation errors were removed. 24/10/21.

- pep8
       - No errors were returned from pep8online.com.


###  Deployment
- The project was deployed using the code Instiutes mock terminal for Heroku.

  - Steps for deployment:
      - Fork or clone this repository
      - Creat a new Heroku app
      - Set the build blocks to Python and Nodejs in that order 
      - Link the Heroku app to the repository
      - Click on **Deploy**
